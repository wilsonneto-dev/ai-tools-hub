# AI Tools Hub

A tool that provides various AI-powered tools on your localhost, using an OpenAI API key. 
Currently featuring Text-to-Speech conversion with translation capabilities, with plans to expand to more AI tools in the future, such as image generation, text summarization, and more.

## Current Features

### Text-to-Speech Converter
- Convert text to natural-sounding speech using OpenAI's TTS API.
- Support for multiple voices with different characteristics.
- Built-in translation to multiple languages before speech conversion.
- Real-time cost estimation and token usage tracking.
- Modern, responsive UI.
- History of conversions with playback capability.
- Support for long texts with automatic chunking.
